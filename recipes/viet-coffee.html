    <h4>Cà Phê Sữa Đá- Vietnamese Iced Coffee with condensed milk</h4>
        <h3><ul>Ingredients</h3>
                <li>4 tsp Trung Nguyen coffee</li>
                <li>2 tsp condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><ol>Steps</h3>
                <li>Boil the water</li>
                <li>Preheat the filter and cup by pouring a bit of boiling water through it.</li>
                <li>Remove the metal filter and pour in 1 heaping tablespoon of Trung Nguyen coffee</li>
                <li>Twist the filter on gently until it just starts to stop. Then turn it little more, a bit less than 1/8 a turn.</li>
                <li>Pour a tiny bit of water in the filter just to wet the grind and to let the grind expand a bit.</li>
                <li>Fill the filter all the way and let it drip. Ideal brewing time comes to about 3 to 5 minutes so adjust the filter accordingly.</li>
                <li>Add the condensed milk</li>
                <li>Let it cool off a bit then pour the brew into a glass filled with ice.</li>
        </ol>
